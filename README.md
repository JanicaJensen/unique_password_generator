# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Password Generator

This is a password generator that is able to produce passwords including anywhere from 8 to 128 characters. It can include lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

```
To use the password generator, one must use the link to the live application which can be found here: https://janicajensen.github.io/unique_password_generator/

Upon clicking "Generate Password", the user will be given a series of prompts that ask for details regarding various criteria. Those criteria will be used to generate a password that will be displayed in the main box on the page.

If one desires a password with less than 8 characters or more than 128, the page will return the user to the generate password window where they can try the process again and can try again when they're ready to follow instructions.

```
